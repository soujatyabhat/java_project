# Sample Factorial Program Using Java

**Factorial** is a mathematical function represented as **N!**, which calculates the product of all positive integers from 1 to **N**. It is commonly used in permutations, combinations, and probability theory. For example, **5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120**. The function grows rapidly, making it essential in computational algorithms and complexity analysis. Factorial also plays a key role in mathematical series like the Taylor series, enhancing numerical approximations.
